The commercial kit list was retrieved from the FDA website in early May 2020 (U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration, 2020a,l). Instruction for Use (IFU) and Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (HCP) documents were also retrieved from the same FDA website.\nEntity/Company Targeted Molecules and Kit Name Details\nAbbott Laboratories IgG only The test can be used only in authorized laboratories on Abbott\u2019s Architect i1000SR and i2000SR\nInc. SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay instruments. This platform can run 100\u2013200 tests/hour, being faster than RT-PCR. It is reported that the\nkit has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.5% (IFU). The company plans to develop an IgM test\ntoo, which would be the 4th product of the company in the market for the COVID-19 diagnosis (Cairns,\n2020).\nAutobio Diagnostics IgM and IgG This is a rapid LFA test based on a one-step capture protocol. The samples can be taken from serum or\nCo. Ltd. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test plasma. The membrane pads are decorated with anti-Spike, anti-IgM, and IgG antibodies lines, which\nserve as a control, IgG detection, and IgM detection lines, respectively. The spike protein-coated gold\nnanoparticles are employed to capture the antibodies and form a reddish color on the pads for fast,\nvisual detection. The protocol implies that the tests are more accurate when used after around 15 days\nfollowing the infection (IFU). Such a test can be used by individuals since they do not require trained\npersonnel or sophisticated equipment.\nDiaSorin Inc. IgG only This kit is a two-step automated immunoassay for the qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG\nLIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG antibodies in serum/plasma samples. The assay is based on chemiluminescent microparticle\nimmunoassay technology (CMIA) in which the particles are functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2\nantigens. Further addition of the Anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate into the incubation\nmedium creates a chemiluminescent signal that is measured as relative light units. The positive percent\nagreement (PPA) was reported as 100% for 88 clinically validated positive samples that are measured\nafter at least 14 days following the infection, whereas this value was \u226425% when tested in the first week\n(n =12) (IFU). This test can only be performed at laboratories; however, the sensitivity of the test is high\nenough to make a decision without further confirmation.\nOrtho-Clinical IgG only This two-step kit is performed with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Pack, the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG\nDiagnostics, Inc. VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti- Calibrator on the ECi/ECiQ/3600 Immunodiagnostic Systems and the 5600/XT 7600 Integrated\nSARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Systems, all available from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. In the first step, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\nbind to the wells that are decorated with the virus spike proteins. The wash step removes the unbound\nmolecules from the sample environment, which is followed by the addition of the horseradish-\nperoxidase-linked anti IgG antibodies. If there is no spike protein-IgG complex in the sample, the second\nantibody will be cleared off the well with the second washing step. If positive, the addition of a final\nenzymatic substrate results in a color change that is measured and correlated with the virus presence.\nThe test showed 100% negative agreement (n =407) and 87.5% (n =48) positive agreement (IFU). The\npositive agreement value of the test is relatively low that probably requires a second confirmatory test.\nMount Sinai IgG only The ELISA-based test kit is only authorized for use at Mount Sinai Laboratory (New York, USA), certified\nLaboratory COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test CLIA (1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7263a), to perform high complexity tests (HCP). The ELISA kits cannot be\nperformed out of laboratory; however, they are both reliable and high throughput and thus a very\nefficient alternative to the RT-PCR method.\nOrtho Clinical Total Antibody The SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody kit by Ortho Clinical, Inc. is quite similar to the one other VITROS kit,\nDiagnostics, Inc.

To bring an end to this pandemic, scientists had\nput their all effort into discovering the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For their dedication, now, we have a handful of\nCOVID-19 vaccines. Worldwide, millions of people are at risk due to the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Despite the lack of clinically\nauthorized antiviral medications and vaccines for COVID-19, clinical trials of many recognized antiviral agents, their\ncombination, and vaccine development in patients with confirmed COVID-19 are still ongoing. This discovery gave us a\nchance to get immune to this disease worldwide and end the pandemic. However, the unexpected capacity of mutation of\nthe SARS-CoV-2 virus makes it difficult, like the recent SAS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Therefore, there is a great necessity\nto spread the vaccination programs and prevent the spread of this dreadful epidemic by identifying and isolating afflicted\npatients. Furthermore, several COVID-19 tests are thought to be expensive, time-consuming, and require the use of adequately\nqualified persons to be carried out efficiently. In addition, we also conversed about how the various COVID-19 testing meth-\nods can be implemented for the first time in a developing country and their cost-effectiveness, accuracy, human resources\nrequirements, and laboratory facilities.\nKeywords SARS-CoV-2 \u00b7 Viral invasion \u00b7 Immunity \u00b7 RT-PCR \u00b7 ELIZA \u00b7 SHERLOCK \u00b7 Coronavirus \u00b7 Antigen\nIntroduction\ncan induce various symptoms, ranging from a simple dis-\nease (such as a common cold) to a potentially fatal infection.\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, a new and highly aggressive Therefore, early infection diagnosis is critical for differenti-\ncoronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syn- ating COVID-19 patients from other unwell people (Carter\ndrome.

Hence,\nthere is an urgent need for rapid, simple, and accurate tests to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-\nvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Performance characteristics of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test should be\nevaluated and compared with the gold standard real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\ntest for diagnosis of COVID-19 cases.\nMethods: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard\u2122 Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor\u00ae, Republic of\nKorea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex\u2122 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene\u00ae, Korea) for detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat\nswabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at\nSiriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during March\u2013May 2020.\nResults: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by\nreal-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individu-\nals ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test\u2019s sensitivity and\nspecificity were 98.33% (95% CI, 91.06\u201399.96%) and 98.73% (95% CI, 97.06\u201399.59%), respectively. One false negative\ntest result was from a sample with a high real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), while five false positive test results\nwere from specimens of pre-operative patients.\nConclusions: The rapid assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection showed comparable sensitivity and specificity with\nthe real-time RT-PCR assay. Thus, there is a potential use of this rapid and simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test as\na screening assay.\nKeywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Rapid antigen, RT-PCR, Thailand\nBackground\nThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic\ncaused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-\n*Correspondence: navin.hor@mahidol.ac.th navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide since\n1 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital,\nits first recorded case in the city of Wuhan, China\nMahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article in December 2019.

Electrochemical PCR: Unexplored Potential\nThe integration of electrochemistry with RT-PCR aims to provide a rapid, miniatur-\nized, hand-held instrument. Electrochemical biosensors work by modification of a work-\ning electrode with a biomolecule that interacts with a specific target analyte present in an\naqueous electrolyte and generates an electrical signal corresponding to its concentration.\nIn the case of an electrochemical PCR, there is an electroactive species whose oxidation or\nreduction signal is correlated to the amount of PCR amplified product. A more challeng-\ning approach is the use of nanomaterials to tag the DNA primers used in the PCR ampli-\nfication step, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs).\nThe labeled amplified products are then further quantified via the generation of electro-\nchemical signals.\nElectrochemical systems offer the benefits of being seamlessly implemented into\ncompact and intelligent systems, enabling high versatility and real-time detection. More-\nover, electrochemically active labels (such as metal-complex, organic molecules, etc.) are\nmore durable than fluorescent dyes (Cy5, FAM, etc.) and are a notable factor toward the\ncommercial applications of electrochemical-RT-PCR (EPCR). The power and sample vol-\nume requirements are lower for electrochemical biosensors compared with RT-PCR. De-\nspite the considerable interest, electrochemical biosensors have garnered in the context of\nCOVID-19 detection, the clinical industry appears reluctant to adopt this technology for\npractical and commercial use.Biosensors2021,11,141 6of12\nLu and group showed that RT-dPCR has a detection limit ten-fold lower than that of\nRT-PCR[34].

Healthcare\nresources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment\noptions are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention,\ndiagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in\norder to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important\nstrategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics,\nhygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services\nin order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action\nand political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic.\n\u00a9 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.\nThis is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-\nnd/4.0/).\nThe search for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine\nThere is an intense global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine. As of\nAugust 29, 2020, 143 vaccine candidates were in preclinical\nevaluation and 46 candidate vaccines were being tested in human\nclinical trials (Phases I\u2013III) (Anon, 2020a; Anon, 2020b). Nine\nvaccine candidates had entered Phase III trials in several countries,\nutilizing thousands of volunteers. The Phase III candidates were\ndeveloped by: Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd, China\n(NCT04456595); the University of Oxford, UK (ISRCTN89951424);\nCanSino Biologics, China (NCT04526990); Wuhan Institute of\nBiological Products, China (ChiCTR2000034780); Beijing Institute\nof Biological Products, China (ChiCTR2000034780); ModernaTX\nInc., USA (NCT04470427); Gamaleya Research Institute, Russia\n(NCT04530396); BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer (NCT04368728);\nand Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies (NCT04505722) (Anon,\n2020a).\nTo develop these vaccines, various new and old techniques have\nbeen used to produce an immune response. These include: genetic\nvaccines, where one or more of the coronavirus\u2019s genes are used;\nviral vector vaccines, where a virus (unable to replicate) is used to\ndeliver coronavirus genes into cells to make viral proteins; protein-\nbased vaccines, using coronavirus spike protein or its fragment;\nand whole-virus vaccines, using weakened or inactivated viruses\n(Anon, 2020b). Sinovac Biotech, Co. Ltd Beijing has developed a\npromising inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell) and tested it\nsuccessfully in Phase I/II trials among 744 healthy Chinese\nparticipants aged 18\u201359 years (NCT04352608) (Figure 1). The\nresults from Phase I/II trials showed that a two-dose schedule of\nthe vaccine was well tolerated, safe (without any serious adverse\nreactions), and immunogenic (producing high titers of\nSinovac\nantibodies).\nis presently conducting Phase III trials in Brazil, Saudi\nArabia, Turkey, Chile, and Indonesia, and soon in Bangladesh.\nAccording to many vaccinologists, inactivated vaccines may be the\nbest choice against COVID-19 because there is no risk of reversion\nto a virulent form. Inactivated vaccines have been extremely\neffective over the past century in inducing protection against many\ndeadly viral pathogens, such as polio, rabies, HAV, and influenza.\nAnother promising vaccine developed by the University of\nOxford is a chimpanzee adenoviral vectored coronavirus vaccine,\nwhich was developed within 100 days after deciphering the\ngenetic sequence of the virus. The results published in the Lancet\nshowed that a single dose of vaccine was safe and immunogenic in\nPhase I/II trials (Folegatti et al., 2020). Oxford\u2019s commercial and\nmanufacturing partner AstraZeneca has already received advance\norders for billions of doses worldwide. Combined Phase II/III trials\nand a separate Phase III study to test the safety and efficacy of the\nvaccine are being conducted among tens of thousands of\nparticipants in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa (Mahase, 2020).\nThese two vaccine candidates have created hope that a vaccine will\nbe available for early 2021.\nThere are still questions on whether these vaccines will be\navailable for LMICs or if vaccine production facilities will be\nadequate to assure a reliable supply within a suitable timeline\nframe to meet global demand. More specifically, there must be a\ntransparent global allocation system to prioritize access to the\nvaccines at low cost for frontline healthcare workers and to people\nliving in poorer countries with a higher risk of severe illness and\ndeath. As COVID-19 is highly contagious (R0 2.5), we will need to\nvaccinate approximately 80% of the population with a vaccine with\n80% proven efficacy. To ensure equity of access and international\ndeployment we must support global randomized controlled trials\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.009\n1201-9712/\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND\nlicense\nInternational\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\nJournal of Infectious Diseases 101 (2020) 98\u2013101\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nInternational Journal of Infectious Diseases\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/ijidof several leading vaccine candidates through the \u2018The WHO\nSolidarity Vaccines Trials\u2019 (Krause et al., 2020). To provide the\nvaccines free of cost to resource-poor nations, we will need a global\nfund supported by the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, the\nWellcome Trust, and the G8 nations (Moon et al., 2011). Even if\nsuccessful, it is unlikely that vaccination will be a standalone\nstrategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 (Ross et al., 2020).\nRT-qPCR diagnosis of COVID-19\nWHO has recommended nucleic acid amplification tests using\nRT-qPCR for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (WHO,\n2020). This is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 and is\npracticed all over the world, including resource-poor countries.\nHowever, most LMICs are struggling to test samples and track the\ntrue infection rate due to a lack of laboratory facilities, trained\nmanpower and regular supply of RT-qPCR kits. Therefore, the\ninfection rates these countries are forecasting may actually\nrepresent only the tip of the iceberg. At the beginning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Bangladesh had only one RT-qPCR laboratory\n\u2013 at the Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control Research\n(IEDCR) \u2013 designated for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for\nwhole\nthe\ncountry (170 million), but now there are 77 RT-PCR labs\n(Figure 2) conducting approximately 20 000 tests daily (Director-\nate General of Health Services (DGHS), 2020). A lack of trained staff\ncapable of performing the molecular biology experiments required\nfor testing for COVID-19 (e.g. viral RNA extraction and qPCR) and\nable to interpret the results is a major limitation in resource-poor\ncountries. Recently, several publications have reported the\nsuccessful use of loop-mediated isothermal amplification\n(LAMP)-based protocols to test for COVID-19 in urine, saliva, as\nwell as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, both with or\nwithout the requirement for viral RNA extraction (Nagura-Ikeda\net al., 2020). Therefore, alternative testing protocols such as LAMP,\nwhich utilize rapid antigen detection with limited resources and\navailable manpower, will be extremely useful.\nSerological testing of COVID-19\nSerological tests are comparatively easier to perform, and\nrequire less technical expertise and equipment compared with\nnucleic acid-based detection (Zainol Rashid et al., 2020). Serologi-\ncal tests can complement RT-PCR in the diagnosis of acute\ninfection, sick or hospitalized patients with severe symptoms who\nhave tested negative with RT-PCR, or for determining the antibody\nstatus of healthcare professionals (and other workers) who are\nready to return to work after being ill with COVID-19. Serological\ntesting could also be used for investigating the attack rate of an\nongoing outbreak in the community, detecting the prevalence of\nasymptomatic carriers, and for the selection of donors of\nconvalescent sera for treatment purposes (Bai et al., 2020). At\nthe national level, expanding testing capacity through antibody\ntesting will enable large-scale screening at the population level,\ngenerating crucial intelligence on estimates of disease spread and\nmortality attributable to COVID-19 and ensuring timely imple-\nmentation of containment measures.\nDue to the unprecedented demand for rapid diagnostic testing\nto enable the efficient treatment and mitigation of COVID-19, the\nUS FDA has allowed more widespread access to serology testing by\nissuing emergency use authorization for serological tests (Anon,\n2020c). One of the lab-based automated testing platforms for\nserological testing is Elecsys1 Anti-SARS-CoV-2, by Roche Diag-\nnostics, which is a qualitative total antibody test (IgM and IgG) that\ndetects antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients using the\nnucleocapsid protein. The Elecsys assay has high clinical sensitivity\n(99.5%; (cid:1)14 days\u2019 post-PCR confirmation) and overall specificity\n(99.81%), resulting in highly reliable and accurate results.\nMoreover, it is a quick test, providing results within 18 minutes.\nCombining such immunoassays with molecular diagnostics is\ndeemed the best approach for Bangladesh and other LMICs, and is\npresently being conducted in 21 states of India (Anon, 2020d). The\nDirectorate General of Drug Administration of Bangladesh has not\nyet approved any serological tests for the country except for\nresearch purposes.\nLow-cost therapeutics\nIn the absence of a vaccine to tackle COVID-19, many\nrepurposed drugs have been identified in observational series,\nor are being used according to anecdotal, in vitro, or extrapolated\nevidence. The repositioning of old drugs for use as antiviral\ntreatments for COVID-19 patients is an intuitive strategy during the\npandemic because the safety profiles, side-effects, posology, and\ndrug interactions of these drugs are already established. These\ndrugs include remdesivir, chloroquine, favipiravir, danoprevir,\nritonavir, bromhexine hydrochloride, hydrochloroquine, and con-\nvalescent plasma. In a resource-limited country such as\nBangladesh, we feel strongly that if such drugs are\nFigure\nscientifically\n1. Sinovac\u2019s SARS-CoV 2 (Vero Cell) inactivated vaccine \u2013 one of China\u2019s\nleading vaccine candidates.\nFigure 2. The icddr,b virology laboratory in Bangladesh, where approximately 500\nRT-qPCR COVID-19 tests are performed daily for the government by 10\nA.B.\nstaff\nmembers.\nAziz et al. / International Journal of Infectious Diseases 101 (2020) 98\u2013101 99proven to be safe and effective, then they should be made\navailable to the general population and free for the indigent\npopulation. The icddr,b laboratory is at present conducting a\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in three\nCOVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Dhaka city, comparing iver-\nmectin and doxycycline in combination or ivermectin alone for\nthe treatment of adult Bangladeshi patients.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh continues to\nproduce 98% of the medicines used domestically, and exports\nhigh-quality drugs to over 150 countries, including Europe and\nNorth America. This outstanding growth of the drug industry\noccurred following the Bangladesh government\u2019s 1982 Drug Act,\npromoting local pharmaceutical enterprizes. This resulted in\nlocal institutions being able to produce inexpensive, high-\nquality, generic drugs that do not require extensive and costly\nhuman trials. Bangladesh, as an LMIC, is exempt from patent\nrestrictions until 2032, and is free to copy any drug on the market\nor in the pipeline, while more developed countries can only copy\nout-of-patent drugs. As a result, soon after Abbott Pharmaceuti-\ncal announced that one of its antiviral drugs (remdesivir) showed\ngood safety and efficacy against severe COVID-19 in the USA,\nBangladeshi Pharma were the first to make generic copies of the\ndrug and export them globally.\nWASH preventive measures\nThe rapid monitoring of COVID-19 transmission pathways is\nrequired for prevention, intervention, and control. Studies have\nshown that COVID-19 viral RNA can be persistently shed in the\nfeces for a maximum of 33 days after the patient has tested\nnegative for respiratory viral RNA (Gupta et al., 2020), although it\nis yet to be confirmed that fecal\u2013oral transmission is indeed\npossible (Quilliam et al., 2020). Safely managing fecal waste from\ninfected, recovering, and recovered patients poses a significant\nchallenge in developing countries and in urban slums. Despite\nseveral uncertainties, new horizons are opening up, as shown by\nrecent reviews on testing for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, aimed at\nearly detection and monitoring of outbreaks. Thus far, researchers\nhave found traces of the SARS-CoV-2 in sewage in the Netherlands,\nAustralia, China, India, the USA, and Sweden. Evidence from studies\non hand hygiene and influenza potentially provides a useful\ncomparison for COVID-19. A systematic review by Saunders-\nHastings et al. (2017) showed frequent handwashing to have a\nsignificant protective effect against pandemic influenza (Figure 3).\nAiello et al. (2008) found that handwashing reduces the rate of\nrespiratory infections by removing respiratory pathogens from the\nhands, thus preventing them from entering the body or passing on\nto other people. Further evidence suggests that washing hands\nwith soap after defecation and before eating can cut the respiratory\ninfection rate by up to 25% (Curtis and Cairncross, 2003).\nConvenient and accessible handwashing techniques are therefore\nneeded on entering or leaving households and in public places,\nespecially after coughing or sneezing.\nDelivery of essential health services\nA potential outbreak response program for COVID-19 preven-\ntion can be deployed at three levels: a mass strategy, a district/\nward strategy, and a household strategy. A mass strategy can be\ndeployed within a city or town, where residents will be informed of\nthe \u2018COVID prevention program\u2019 in their respective district or ward\nvia SMS messages, local health centers, EPI centers, pharmacies,\nand community notice boards. Health education would focus on\nthe risk factors for COVID-19 and better cough hygiene practices.\nMass media on COVID-19 could showcase a Protect your family from\nCOVID-19 video, to illustrate effective WASH practices aimed\nlowering\nat\nrisk. As part of a district/ward strategy, an early warning\nsurveillance system could be deployed using: rapid diagnostic\ntesting (e.g. the Roche antibody test) for suspected COVID cases, at\nhealth facilities and local hospitals; periodic testing of municipali-\nty sewage water for the presence of SARS-CoV-2; Android-based\nphone reporting of real-time test results; GIS risk mapping of\npatients\u2019 addresses. Finally, a family emergency WASH kit could be\nutilized as a household strategy for families with a newly\ndiagnosed family member. The kit for COVID-19 could comprise:\na prevention poster for the family on how to minimize the risk of\nacquiring and transmitting COVID-19; \u2018soapy water\u2019 package (soap\nand three dispensers) \u2013 enough for a family of five for 30 days; daily\nhousehold disinfectant with bleach (3\u20136% sodium hypochlorite);\nand masks for wearing at home.\nConclusions\nVaccination alone will not halt the COVID-19 pandemic. Low-\ncost, evidence-based, integrated control strategies will be required.\nWe must ensure access to reliable diagnostics in order to\ndetermine the true burden of disease in the community. To\nsupport the existing health system, data on the safety and\neffectiveness of locally available, affordable, and cost-effective\ntherapeutic drugs need to be generated in order to treat COVID-19\npatients. A combination of effective vaccination, treatment, and\nWASH will ensure enhanced protection against COVID-19.\nCollaboration at the international, national, regional, and local\nlevel is parmount if we are to halt the spread of infection and end\nthe pandemic.\nConflicts of interest\nWe declare no conflicts of\nFigure\ninterest.\n3.

TheWHOreportedthat\nmorethan29millioncasesofCOVID-19,includingapproximately900,000deaths,haveoccurredasof\n16September2020(https://covid19.who.int/). TocontrolthespreadofSARS-CoV-2infections,rapid\nidentificationandisolationofpatientsarerequired.\nThegoldstandardforCOVID-19diagnosisisreversetranscription-quantitativePCR(RT-qPCR)\nusingnasopharyngeal(N)swabs,throat(T)swabs,orsaliva[2].

Therefore,specimens\nneedtobetransportedtoandexaminedatsitesthathaveRT-qPCRcapability,whichdelaysthetest\nresultandincreasestheanxietyofthesuspectedCOVID-19patients. Toimprovethissituation,rapid\nantigentests(RATs)forCOVID-19,whichdoesnotrequirespecificandexpensivemachinery,have\nbeenapprovedforclinicaluseinJapanandothercountries,andthesensitivityofthesetestshasbeen\ncompared with that of several kinds of RT-qPCR [3\u20139].

Circles filled in black indicate both results were\npositive, those filled in gray indicate that one was positive, no color indicates both were negative.\nSince the type of specimen likely affects the sensitivity of RATs, we assessed our results\naccording to specimen type (gargle lavage, saliva, T swab, nasal vestibule swab, N swab, sputum,\nand tracheal aspirate). Although the Cq value varied between specimens from 18.8 to 36.0, gargle\nlavage, T swabs, and nasal vestibule swabs showed higher Cq values than the other types of\nspecimens (Table 3).

All four RATs failed to detect virus antigens in all 7\ngargle lavages, 2 T swabs, and 1 nasal vestibule swabs, although the virus was isolated from one T\nswab sample. Since N swabs and saliva are suitable specimens for diagnosis in clinics, we plotted the\nresults from the RATs and virus isolation based on the number of days after onset that the specimens\nwere collected and the Cq values of the RT-qPCR (Figure 2).

Discussion\nHere we evaluated the sensitivity of four RATs available in Japan in August 2020. The overall\nsensitivity of Standard Q COVID-19 Ag and Espline SARS-CoV-2 was better than that of ImmunoAce\nSARS-CoV-2 and QuickNavi COVID19 Ag. For specimens such as saliva and swabs, Standard Q\nCOVID-19 Ag, Espline SARS-CoV-2, and ImmunoAce SARS-CoV-2 had similar detection\nsensitivities. These three kits detected viral antigens in more than half of the specimens whose Cq\nvalues of RT-qPCR were less than approximately 25. Therefore, these RATs may be suitable for the\ndetection of COVID-19 in individuals who are shedding a large amount of SARS-CoV-2; that is, they\nmay be useful to identify patients with a high likelihood of transmitting the virus to others.\nAll four RATs failed to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which virus was isolated.\nThis finding indicates that the current RATs are likely to miss some COVID-19 patients who are\nshedding infectious SARS-CoV-2. However, it is unclear to what extent such patients would transmit\nvirus to others. Further studies are required to address this point. In addition, the present study used\nswab specimens that were soaked in transport medium; if the specimens were directly soaked in lysis\nbuffer, the sensitivity of the RATs might be improved. The recommended samples for these RATS\nare nasopharyngeal swabs not saliva, and some of the saliva samples from which SARS-CoV-2 was\nisolated gave negative results with all of the RATs tested here. Nonetheless, these RATs need to be\nimproved with respect to their sensitivity.Viruses2020,12,1420 7of8\n4. Discussion\nHereweevaluatedthesensitivityoffourRATsavailableinJapaninAugust2020.
